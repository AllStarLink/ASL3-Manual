# Services Management
The `Cockpit` web console allows the management of all of the running services. You can activate or deactivate services, restart or reload them, or manage their automatic startup.

## Start, Stop, and Restart Services
This procedure stops or starts system services using the web console interface. You can filter the services by name or description and also by Enabled, Disabled, or Static automatic startup. The interface shows the current state of the service and its recent logs.

1. Log in to the web console with administrator privileges. For details, see [Cockpit Basics](cockpit-basics.md)

2. Click **Services** in the web console menu on the left. The default tab for **Services** is **System Services**. If you want to manage targets, sockets, timers, or paths, switch to the respective tab in the menu on top. To open service settings, click on a selected service from the list. You can tell which services are active or inactive by checking the **State** column

3. To start an inactive service, click the **Start** button
