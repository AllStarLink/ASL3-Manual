# Pi Appliance Specifics (Cockpit)
ASL3 features a modern appliance of AllStarLink while retaining the ubiquitous Raspberry Pi experience that's well-documented and familiar to the amateur radio
community worldwide.

## What is the Cockpit Web Console?
The `Cockpit` web console is a web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your AllStarLink Pi Appliance.

The `Cockpit` web console enables you to perform a wide range of administration tasks, including:

* Managing AllStarLink, Asterisk, and its related applications
* Managing services
* Managing user accounts
* Managing and monitoring system services
* Configuring network interfaces
* Reviewing system logs
* Updating software  

The `Cockpit` web console uses the same system concepts as you would use in a terminal, and actions performed in a terminal are immediately reflected in the `Cockpit` web console. That is to say, you can use `Cockpit` and an SSH connection interchangeably as you desire.

You can monitor the logs of application. In addition, you can change the settings directly in the web console or through the terminal.
