# Cockpit Basics

## What is the Cockpit Web Console?
The `Cockpit` web console is a web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your AllStarLink Pi Appliance.

The `Cockpit` web console enables you to perform a wide range of administration tasks, including:

* Managing AllStarLink, Asterisk, and its related applications
* Managing services
* Managing user accounts
* Managing and monitoring system services
* Configuring network interfaces
* Reviewing system logs
* Updating software  

The `Cockpit` web console uses the same system concepts as you would use in a terminal, and actions performed in a terminal are immediately reflected in the `Cockpit` web console. That is to say, you can use `Cockpit` and an SSH connection interchangeably as you desire.

You can monitor the logs of application. In addition, you can change the settings directly in the web console or through the terminal. 

Throughout this documentation a host named `node63001.local` is used as the example host. Substitute that name with your own node's name as it was set during the imaging process.

## Logging In to the Web Console
1. In your web browser, enter the following address to access the web console: `https://node63001.local:9090`

2. The browser may display a warning. Accept the security exception to proceed with the login

## Administrative Access
The web console has a concept of Administrative access. While it does remember the access level across logins, to access certain functions you may need to enable Administrative access from Limited access.

To do that:

1. Click on the bar marked **Limited Access** to enable admin-level access.
