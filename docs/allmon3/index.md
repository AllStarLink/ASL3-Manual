# Allmon3
Allmon is the standard web-based monitoring and management for ASL3.

Allmon3 is the next generation of web dashboards for AllStarLink, rewritten for performance, scalability, and responsiveness.

## Design Goals
Allmon3 features and functionality shall be governed by the following guidelines:

* Use of modern web responsive design for usability on all device form factors and screen sizes
* Clear separation between long-running tasks and client-based display updates
* Permit reduced workload on potentially slow repeater site links by cleanly supporting the ability to run only the pollers on the device controlling the repeater, and run the dashboard in the cloud; easy prevention of unnecessary web traffic, spidering, etc.
* Prioritization of the common use cases of AllStarLink for feature enhancements
