# Updating ASL3
All of the software components that make up ASL3 are provided by software packages (Debian `.deb` files) from an centralized Apt repository. This makes upgrades quick and painless for users.

## Standard Debian Upgrades
Whether ASL3 is installed on a standard Debian 12 installation or you are using the Pi Appliance image, updates follow the standard Debian format:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

This will update all ASL3 software as well as the underlying operating system. AllStarLink will never release any update that is a "breaking change" through the `apt` system that doesn't have either an automated upgrade process or a well-documented manual step-by-step process.

A reboot is only needed when a new Linux kernel has been installed.

Sometimes an update may ask what to do with a configuration file. It is generally best to answer such questions with `N` meaning, "keep your currently-installed version". Such a question will look like:

```
Configuration file '/etc/asterisk/rpt.conf'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** rpt.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N
```

AllStarLink will clearly announce when there is a change that may break existing configurations.

If you want updates to install without any questions being asked specify the `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` variable:

```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt update
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Using this command will automatically choose `N` to any question about configuration - i.e. it will always keep your installed version.

## Note on DAHDI
In the past, managing the DAHDI kernel module needed by `app_rpt` had been problematic during kernel upgrades. Previously, the recommendation had been to never upgrade
the kernel. **This advice is no longer valid and should not be followed for security and practicality reasons.**

ASL3 automatically manages and rebuilds the DAHDI kernel modules during software updates using the DKMS system. After an upgrade, rebooting into a new version of the Linux kernel will "just work".

If, for some strange reason, you need to manually rebuild and install the DAHDI kernel modules, try the following:

```
sudo apt install -y --reinstall dahdi-linux dahdi-dkms
```
