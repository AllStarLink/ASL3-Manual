# ASL3 User Guide

This is the AllStarLink version 3 User's Guide. No doubt you're you've noticed this is not a Wiki. The [ASL Wiki](https://wiki.allstarlink.org) still exists, largely to document ASL1 and ASL3, while this manual covers ASL3 specifics and is the future home for all ASL documentation.

Did you see the "Next" and "Previous" menu items? Those will page to the next section of this document in the order of the bullets below. We think you'll find this an orderly way to learn about ASL3.  Lets get started.
