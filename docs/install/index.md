# ASL3 Installation

Welcome to the Installation section of the manual! We know you are excited to get on with trying out the new ASL3. 

In this section of the manual, you will find instructions on how to create an ASL3 Appliance, using the Raspberry Pi Image, or install ASL3 on Debian 12. 

Before you get started with installing the ASL3 software, do you have a node number assigned? See the [Getting Started](../basics/index.md) section to find out how to request a node number to connect to the AllStarLink network.

Use the Table of Contents on the left to jump to the type of installation you are wishing to perform, but be sure to check out the rest of the topics in this section for other important information. 

Once you've got your new ASL3 installed, be sure to check out the [Basic Operation](../user-guide/index.md) section (see the link at the top of the page).
